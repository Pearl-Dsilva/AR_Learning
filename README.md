# FluentAR: An AR Based Language Learning App
There is a global trend in foreign language demand and proficiency, the rise of Mandarin and Spanish as important languages for business and travel.
AR can be used to improve engagement, perception, and critical thinking skills.
Our initiative centers on creating an AR language learning application aimed at offering users an engaging and immersive learning journey.

## Proposed System
### Object Detection Module:
- Users have the ability to learn new vocabulary in their chosen language based on the objects in their environment. 
- This approach leverages real-world objects rather than animated ones, which aids in better retention of the learned words. 
### Learning Module:
- Learning with the translation of real objects to remember better.
- Displays the data stored in storage and its translation for user to learn what the word means in that language. 
### Quiz Module:
- The quiz section provides feedback to users, helping them track their learning progress effectively.
- Uses the data stored in storage to generate questions in random order.
